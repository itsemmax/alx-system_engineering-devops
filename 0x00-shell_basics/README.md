1: Write a script that prints the absolute path name of the current working directory.


Example:

$ ./0-current_working_directory
/root/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics
$

2:Display the contents list of your current directory.


Example:

$ ./1-listit
Applications    Documents   Dropbox Movies Pictures
Desktop Downloads   Library Music Public
$
 
3:Write a script that changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory.

    You are not allowed to use any shell variables

julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ pwd
/tmp
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ echo $HOME
/home/julien
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ source ./2-bring_me_home
julien@ubuntu:~$ pwd
/home/julien
julien@ubuntu:~$ 

4:Display current directory contents in a long format

Example:

$ ./3-listfiles
total 32
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 sylvain staff 18 Jan 25 00:19 0-current_working_directory
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 sylvain staff 19 Jan 25 00:23 1-listit
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 sylvain staff 18 Jan 25 00:29 2-bring_me_home
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 sylvain staff 18 Jan 25 00:39 3-listfiles
$

5: Display current directory contents, including hidden files (starting with .). Use the long format.

Example:

$ ./4-listmorefiles
total 32
drwxr-xr-x@ 6 sylvain staff 204 Jan 25 00:29 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 43 sylvain staff 1462 Jan 25 00:19 ..
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 sylvain staff 18 Jan 25 00:19 0-current_working_directory
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 sylvain staff 19 Jan 25 00:23 1-listit
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 sylvain staff 18 Jan 25 00:29 2-bring_me_home
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 sylvain staff 18 Jan 25 00:39 3-listfiles
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 sylvain staff 18 Jan 25 00:41 4-listmorefiles
$


6:Display current directory contents.

    Long format
    with user and group IDs displayed numerically
    And hidden files (starting with .)

Example:

$ ./5-listfilesdigitonly
total 32
drwxr-xr-x@ 6 501 20 204 Jan 25 00:29 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 43 501 20 1462 Jan 25 00:19 ..
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 501 20 18 Jan 25 00:19 0-current_working_directory
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 501 20 18 Jan 25 00:23 1-listfiles
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 501 20 19 Jan 25 00:29 2-bring_me_home
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 501 20 20 Jan 25 00:39 3-listfiles
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 501 20 18 Jan 25 00:41 4-listmorefiles
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 501 20 18 Jan 25 00:43 5-listfilesdigitonly
$

7:Create a script that creates a directory named my_first_directory in the /tmp/ directory.

Example:

$ ./6-firstdirectory
$ file /tmp/my_first_directory/
/tmp/my_first_directory/: directory
$

8:Move the file betty from /tmp/ to /tmp/my_first_directory.

Example:

$ ./7-movethatfile
$ ls /tmp/my_first_directory/
betty
$

9:Delete the file betty.

    The file betty is in /tmp/my_first_directory

Example:

$ ./8-firstdelete
$ ls /tmp/my_first_directory/
$

10:Delete the directory my_first_directory that is in the /tmp directory.

Example:

$ ./9-firstdirdeletion
$ file /tmp/my_first_directory
/tmp/my_first_directory: cannot open `/tmp/my_first_directory' (No such file or directory)
$

11:Write a script that changes the working directory to the previous one.

julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ pwd
/tmp
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ cd /var
julien@ubuntu:/var$ pwd
/var
julien@ubuntu:/var$ source ./10-back
/tmp
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ pwd
/tmp


12:Write a script that lists all files (even ones with names beginning
 with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory
 and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format.


13:Write a script that prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the /tmp directory when we will run your script.

Example

ubuntu@ip-172-31-63-244:~$ ./12-file_type
/tmp/iamafile: ELF 64-bit LSB  executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=bd39c07194a778ccc066fc963ca152bdfaa3f971, stripped



14:Create a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__. The symbolic link should be created in the current working directory.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-63-244:/tmp/sym$ ls -la
total 144
drwxrwxr-x  2 ubuntu ubuntu   4096 Sep 20 03:24 .
drwxrwxrwt 12 root   root   139264 Sep 20 03:24 ..
ubuntu@ip-172-31-63-244:/tmp/sym$./13-symbolic_link
ubuntu@ip-172-31-63-244:/tmp/sym$ ls -la
total 144
drwxrwxr-x  2 ubuntu ubuntu   4096 Sep 20 03:24 .
drwxrwxrwt 12 root   root   139264 Sep 20 03:24 ..
lrwxrwxrwx  1 ubuntu ubuntu      7 Sep 20 03:24 __ls__ -> /bin/ls

15:Create a script that copies all the HTML files from the current
 working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy
 files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer
 than the versions in the parent of the working directory.

You can consider that all HTML files have the extension .html


#advanced


1: let's move 
Create a script that moves all files beginning with an uppercase letter to the directory /tmp/u.

You can assume that the directory /tmp/u will exist when we will run your script



Create a script that deletes all files in the current working directory 
that end with the character ~.

3:Tree
Create a script that creates the directories welcome/, welcome/to/ and welcome/to/school in the current directory.

You are only allowed to use two spaces (and lines) in your script, not more.

4:. Life is a series of commas, not periods

Write a command that lists all the files and directories of the current directory, separated by commas (,).

    Directory names should end with a slash (/)
    Files and directories starting with a dot (.) should be listed
    The listing should be alpha ordered, except for the directories . and .. which should be listed at the very beginning
    Only digits and letters are used to sort; Digits should come first
    You can assume that all the files we will test with will have at least one letter or one digit
    The listing should end with a new line

5: File type: School
Create a magic file school.mgc that can be used with the command file to
 detect School data files. School data files always contain the string
 SCHOOL at offset 0.
